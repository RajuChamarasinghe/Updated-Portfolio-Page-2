                <p class="paragraph-1">I am Raju Chamarasinghe, a student at University of Washington, where I am
                    completing a certificate course in Full-stack Web Development. I first became interested in software
                    development as a junior college student where I thought myself to code through websites and reading
                    books.</p>

                <p class="paragraph-1">I am proficient in creating webpages using HTML and CSS and have used the Twitter
                    Bootstrap library for styling. I am also proficient in JavaScript and have experience using the
                    ReactJS frontend framework, developing for the backend using NodeJS framework. Some of the
                    JavaScript libraries I have used are Express, Handlebars, jQuery, and Cheerio. Some of the databases
                    I have worked with are MySQL and MongoDB. I also have deployment experience with Heroku and Github.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph-1">Before starting to code, I spent eleven years as a mechanical engineering
                    designer for reputable high-tech companies, including EOSpace, Inc. and Omax Corporations in the
                    U.S. After a successful career change, I am now ready to work as a junior software developer. I not
                    only rely on my coding competency, but also on my significant leadership skills as well. I am a self
                    motivated team player and able to learn new technologies quickly.</p>

                <p class="paragraph-1">I am also a musician and enjoy playing the guitar and keyboard and currently live
                    in Lynnwood, WA with my wife.</p>
